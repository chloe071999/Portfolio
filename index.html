                    <p>Many students use Google Maps to search for study spots only see the location information, but no specific information about the study spots, such as wifi, facilities, etc., so sometimes they walk into a study spot that doesn't meet their needs.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Brisbane Study Spots use a database to assign tags to each study spot, and users can filter out their preferred study spots by selecting their preferred tags to find the most suitable study environment for their needs. Our idea was to use two databases, Queensland Public Library and Restaurants, which provide information on libraries and cafes that can be used for studying. We believe that the target users could benefit a lot from this web application. We want our users to have a pleasant experience when using this application.</p>

                    <p>The final theme of our site is that users filter out their preferred learning locations by selecting different tags to find the learning environment that best suits their needs. Compared to the initial theme, we removed the user-defined search function. This change was based on 2 things: firstly, the difficulty of implementing the code to capture the keywords in the search bar and then match the API results, which was difficult for us; secondly, we wanted to highlight the features of our application, which is to visualize the learning spaces through user preference tags, so that users can pick the learning spaces they are most satisfied with.</p>

                    <h5>03 Rapid Design Sprint</h5>
                    <p>During the discussion, we developed the idea further - we could also add information about parks, where many people like to study outdoors. We also added additional tags that users might need: business status, printer, quiet study room, accessibility.
                        So we were faced with the problem: how to get the data corresponding to these tags? Chao Ma suggested that he could use JavaScript to solve the problem by getting the real-time time and then determining whether the student spots are in business status.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In addition to the technical issues, we also face the problem of user experience - many people may feel unsure how to start using the application for the first time. There were too many tags, but the meaning of the tabs was not obvious. So we decided to visualize the tags by adding a Card Page to form a scene map with the tags selected by the user. We believe we can improve the user experience very well with this approach. 
                        <br><br>To increase interaction, we add a sharing function to the Card Page so that users can share libraries that meet their needs with their friends. Double the friends, double the efficiency.

                    <h5>04 My Contribution</h5>
                    <p>I was in charge of the design work in the team. In part A, I defined the visual style, made the Card Page prototype, and created some interaction flowcharts.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>First of all, for the visual style part, I spent some time comparing various illustration websites and finally decided the most suitable free copyrighted illustration series for our website. The target users of our application are students, so the visual style needs to be youthful. The product positioning of our application is to help students find the most suitable library and improve their study efficiency, so the illustration style needs to be simple, sharp and symbolic. The final source of illustration was Blush, which has a very simple and sharp style with representative elements. In addition, it can reassemble elements on its own, which is very similar to the use of tags.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Secondly, I was responsible for the prototyping and interaction flow of the card page in prototyping. I made two prototypes before rapid design and seven prototypes after rapid design.</p>

                    <h5>05 Reflection</h5>
                        <p>Focus on testing.</p>
                        <p>No matter how well prepared and detailed we are and how much we know about UX theory, we can only really experience the UX when we participate in user testing as users. We always take it for granted that what we understand, users will understand too. For example, the functions of tags and Card Page, we all understand that they are for filtering user needs. But in the process of testing, we found that their functions would make users feel confused. Based on this situation, we just redesigned Card Page.
                        The ease of use of an application should be determined by complete and detailed user testing. It should not be determined by intuition as a designer. I will keep this test reflection in mind for future application design and pay attention to testing.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I think that I also developed many personal and professional skills during this process. The experience of teamwork is invaluable and in the form of teamwork in future projects and work, this opportunity will allow me to adapt to the teamwork model in advance. I also learned new software skills, such as prototyping with Figma, illustration portfolio with Blush, and user flow creation. These will be very helpful for subsequent course work and future work projects.

                    <p>Our group's initial ambition for our application was too big: to use both the tabs and the search bar to call the API, to add cool features to the Card Page. But the MVP concept tells me that we only need products with enough functionality to meet the needs of our users.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>There are two core features of our application: the filtering system and study space visualiser
                    </p>
                    <p>The filter system allows users to select the features they want in their study spot. The Study Space Visualiser shows them a mock up of what their ideal space includes. Users can share it or save to their profile.</p>

                    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="center-bottom" data-aos-duration="700">In the process of completing the final proof of concept, the problem is the hierarchical ordering of the tags corresponding to the images. What images should be placed at the bottom and what images should be placed at the top, and how to avoid overlapping images to affect the user experience?
                        I think we should divide tags into three parts: the background part representing libraries, parks and cafes; the middle part representing conference tables, desks and other furniture; and the top part representing business status and quiet rooms. This way, even though there is an inevitable overlap, users can still clearly understand the information about the learning space.
                        I made 7 prototype pages according to the categories, and the group members could also modify the elements according to their own ideas to complete the proof of final card page concept.

                    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="center-bottom" data-aos-duration="700">
                        At first we had a vague understanding of the Card Page, even thinking of it as a Vibe Page with only aesthetic value, which was quickly overturned because it had no useful function, no purpose, and no service to the user. We analyzed the needs of our target users: to find study spots that meet their needs, and a new idea was born: to use visual tags to form a Card Page that reflects the needs of the user. in this way, the user has a feeling of being understood. It also distinguished us from other applications that were looking for similar study spots: Google Maps doesn't understand you, but we do.
                        In each subsequent design, I would question whether each element and page of the interface was serving the user? What is its purpose? If it is a page that does not provide any function, it will waste the user's time and reduce the user's experience.
                    </p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="center-bottom" data-aos-duration="800">By knowing enough about the users and what they wanted to achieve when using the product, we were able to narrow down the functionality of the application at the beginning of the project and make the process more efficient. In terms of the end result, we built a minimum viable product. But reducing the scope of the product's functionality should be done before, not during, the project.</p>

                    <h5>01 visual aesthetics</h5>
                    <p>In the initial web styling, the team thought we didn't have to follow the prototype because our application had changed somewhat from the prototype. I gathered my teammates' opinions to create the first version of the web style. Blue as the base color represents calmness and sanity, which fits the positioning of the application. However, from my aesthetic point of view, this version of the web style looked a bit clunky, outdated and retro. I admit that my inexperience also contributed to this result.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>After my teammates agreed, I decided to reverse the visual style of the previous version of the design. In this version of the web design, I added line elements based on the prototype. The visual style is more simple, clean, modern and I think more in line with the aesthetics of the young students, the target users of our app.</p>

                    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="center-bottom" data-aos-duration="800">In the final delivery my teammates made changes to the background color of the web style, which was different from what I showed in this part. But I am most satisfied with the final version of the web page that I modified. So in this part I show the web page I designed.</p>

                <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="center-bottom" data-aos-duration="500">I was responsible for the web design and visual design of the application. At first, my teammates didn't believe me, because I was a first semester student. They created an original web page on their own(It was very primitive and completely different from the pages I designed afterwards. It's documented in my journal). I gained my teammates' approval and trust by designing a page on my own. After taking over the design task, I completely reversed the original webpage and redesigned the entire application webpage and visual.</p>

                <h5>03 Reflection</h5>
                <p>This was my first web application production team project. It was a great experience for me! Through this process, I not only had the opportunity to practice my web design skills, but also enhanced my UX skills by learning about user testing, and user-centered design. I learned a lot in just three months.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Get to know your peers on the team.</p>
                <p>It is beneficial to get to know everyone on the team in Studio and additional meetings as well as to understand their strengths and expectations for the team! Getting to know the people on your team can help improve communication and collaboration, as well as reduce friction and misunderstandings caused by a lack of understanding.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Moving forward while receiving conflicting feedback.</p>
                <p>Understanding the perspectives of everyone on the team is critical to moving forward, but sometimes there can be conflicts. There were a few times when we disagreed within the group, but we eventually made a final design decision with sound reasoning by communicating with each other. In a conflict we don't know which is the right answer. Whether it's a project or a life, we can only move on without knowing the right answer, get past obstacles, and move on to new attempts.</p>

                    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="center-bottom" data-aos-duration="600">I think of a portfolio as a tool for presenting oneself. The portfolio for this course is a record, summary and reflection of the course and project. I believe that the portfolio will be very important to me in my future internship or work process, so this portfolio is not only a course work, but also an important piece for my future job search process.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="center-bottom" data-aos-duration="700">I positioned myself on the front page to show my personal brand and make a lasting impression. I was previously a beauty blogger with 700,000 followers, so I think establishing yourself as a brand is an essential part of the process of getting what you want to achieve. My aesthetic is less is more, for example, when decorating a house we don't have to use every space to its fullest, let the table be just a table, let the sofa be just a sofa, don't put drawers on the table, don't make the sofa a fold-out bed. Let it be itself, it is beautiful enough.

                        This is the part of the portfolio that I am most proud of and put the most effort into. I found a lot of sites with dynamic backgrounds or gradient backgrounds, but none of them were what I wanted. I wanted users to feel like I could always give my users a response when viewing my portfolio, even just changing the background.

                    <h5>Embrace the Adventure</h5>
                    <p>At the beginning of this course, I was a rookie who knew nothing about web design, and even my teammates did not expect much from me. However, at the end of the course, I completed my part-website design.
                        This experience will make me more brave to face and overcome difficulties and challenges in the future. I am grateful to my teammates who have been waiting for me instead of pushing me to improve my skills and for supporting my growth. I will continue to work hard in the future.

                    <h5>Be Insight</h5>
                    <p>During the project I wasted some time and effort on things that don't seem important now. For example, the web design process was full of unnecessary changes. The web design was being revised even towards the end of the project. If the preliminary user research, user experience, prototyping, visual style and other steps at the beginning of the project were all done properly and effectively, the efficiency of the web design process would have been improved. Therefore, in the future, I will improve my insight to better allocate my energy and improve my web design skills.</p>

                    <h5>User Centered Design</h5>
                    <p>In this design activity, one of my shortcomings is that I did not finish the preliminary user experience and user testing part very well. I did not have a very clear concept of application design in the preliminary stage, and I just followed the steps step by step for the user experience and user testing part without generating any real thinking. Our application is obviously a user-centered product, so it is more important to pay attention to users' personal pain points, emotions, interests and other information to better meet their needs. If I had more time, I would have done more user research and made this part better.</p>
